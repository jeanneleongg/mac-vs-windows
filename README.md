# mac-vs-windows
This repo contains a collaborative final team assignment for the Machine Learning course taught by Professor Chase Kusterer at Hult International Business School. The goal of this project is to analyze and interpret an unsupervised learning problem based on survey data.

# Business Case: Windows or Mac?

Countless consumers have pondered this question when preparing to buy a new computer. As a result, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have been rigorously researching several aspects of consumer buying behavior in regards to the decision making behind this question. Both firms have commissioned research and analysis teams to study aspects such as system architecture, security, and overall performance.
 
Recently, Apple has decided to approach this question from the perspective of the Big Five personality traits as well as the Hult DNA. As such, your team has been commissioned to run an analysis on these factors. Apple is looking forward to receiving your key insights, as well as an organized Jupyter Notebook that can be shared with their internal analytical teams. They also have sent you a kind reminder to utilize external research to support your findings and to give details related to details such as audience size.
